# Database Management System: A Simple SQL Implementation Using Python
This repository contains a simple SQL Database Management System (DBMS) implemented in Python. The primary objective of the project is to simulate basic functionalities of a SQL database like parsing SQL queries, managing schema metadata, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features
- ✅ SQL Query Parsing (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- ✅ Schema Management with Foreign Keys
- ✅ Full CRUD Operations with Constraint Checking
- ✅ **Transactions** (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
- ✅ **Hash-Based Indexing** for Fast Lookups
- ✅ **Web GUI** (phpMyAdmin-inspired interface)
- ✅ Error Handling with Detailed Messages

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Seed the Database (Recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create complete student database with sample data and indexes
python seeder.py
```

### **2. Start the Web GUI**
```bash
python gui.py
# Open http://localhost:5001
```

### **3. Or Use CLI REPL**
```bash
python run.py
# DB_2023-12345> SELECT * FROM students;
```

## 🎓 Student Database Example

The seeder creates a complete **Student Record Management System** with:

- **7 Tables**: departments, instructors, courses, students, enrollments, grades, attendance
- **59 Sample Records**: 10 students, 7 courses, 12 enrollments, 12 grades, etc.
- **19 Indexes**: Optimized for common queries (major lookup, course search, etc.)

## 🧪 Testing

All test files are in the `tests/` directory:

```bash
cd tests

# Run comprehensive test suite
python test_final_comprehensive.py

# Run specific tests
python test_crud_isolated.py
python test_transactions.py
python test_index.py

# View test documentation
cat README.md
```

See [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for complete test documentation.

## Environment
```
python==3.9
lark==1.1.5
flask==3.0.0  # For web GUI
```
Storage is backed by Python's built-in [`dbm`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dbm.html) module, so there are no native libraries to install (this replaces the original BerkeleyDB backend). This is what makes the project run identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

### Run natively
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

### Run in Docker (recommended for a consistent, cross-platform setup)
The repo ships a `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `Makefile` so everyone runs the same environment regardless of host OS:
```
make build      # build the image (once)
make run        # start the interactive SQL REPL
make shell      # open a shell inside the container
make test       # pipe a few statements through the engine as a smoke test
make reset      # wipe the database volume
```
VS Code / Cursor users can instead "Reopen in Container" (see `.devcontainer/`).

> Note: table and column **identifiers must start with a letter and contain only letters and underscores** — names like `t2` are rejected by the grammar as a syntax error. Use `account`, `students`, etc.

## Sample I/O

```
DB_2023-12345> create table account 
(
account_number int not null, 
branch_name char(15)
); 
DB_2023-12345> 'account' table is created
```
```
DB_2023-12345> drop table account;
DB_2023-12345> 'account' table is dropped
```
```
DB_2023-12345> explain account;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
table_name [account]
column_name		    type		  null		key
account_number		char(10)	N		    PRI
branch_name		    char(15)	N		    FOR
balance			      int		    Y  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```
```
DB_2023-12345> show tables
------------------------
branch
customer
loan
borrower
account
depositor
------------------------
```
```
DB_2023-12345> insert into account values(9732, 'Perryridge');
DB_2023-12345> The row is inserted
```
```
DB_2023-12345> delete from account where branch_name = 'Perryridge';
DB_2023-12345> 5 row(s) are deleted
```
```
DB_2023-12345> select * from account; 
+----------------+-------------+---------+ 
| ACCOUNT_NUMBER | BRANCH_NAME | BALANCE | 
+----------------+-------------+---------+
| A-101
| A-102
| A-201
| A-215
| A-217
| A-222

+----------------+-------------+---------+
DB_2023-12345> select customer_name, borrower.loan_number, amount from borrower, loan where borrower.loan_number = loan.loan_number and branch_name = 'Perryridge'; 
+---------------+-------------+--------+
| CUSTOMER_NAME | LOAN_NUMBER | AMOUNT | 
+---------------+-------------+--------+
| Adams | L-16 | 1300 | 
| Hayes | L-15 | 1500 | 
+---------------+-------------+--------+
```

## Core Modules
- `grammar.lark`: Defines SQL grammar in EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form). Using the Lark API, this file serves as the basis for parsing SQL queries into AST (Abstract Syntax Trees).

- `sql_transformer.py`: Inherits from Lark's `Transformer` class to handle the AST generated by the parser. It processes and returns tables, records, and columns selected in the query.

- `db_model.py`: Defines the data structures for schemas and records (each represented by `Table` and `Record` classes). It also contains a `DB` class which acts as a wrapper for manipulating `dbm` key/value stores. Metadata of schemas is stored in `MetaDB`, which inherits from the `DB` class.

- `dbms.py`: Handles SQL statements such as `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `EXPLAIN/DESCRIBE/DESC`, `SHOW TABLES`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `SELECT` through a `DBMS` class.

- `messages.py`: Defines exception classes for logging and error messages that indicate whether the SQL command was executed successfully by the `DBMS` class.

- `utils.py`: Defines function mappings for unknown variables and logical operations in SQL, as well as for parsed comparison/null operators. It also includes functions for validating data types, including `date` data types.

- `run.py`: Splits the query sequence into multiple statements and performs actions for each query. It imports the `Lark` class from the Lark library and generates a parser based on the grammar defined in the `grammar.lark` file. It also imports `SQLTransformer` to interpret the AST generated by the parser and extract the necessary data. The corresponding handling functions for SQL statements are called from the `DBMS` instance, and the result or error message is output.



## Implementation Details
- `grammar.lark`
  - Adds `null` data type to the `INSERT` statement to allow null values.
- `sql_transformer.py`
  - The transformer navigates the AST in a bottom-up manner, collecting and categorizing data into queries, tables, and record information as it traverses the nodes. The result is returned in the form of a dictionary.
  - Input table and column names are converted to lowercase.
  - Type casting is done for `int` values as Python's `int` and for `null` values as Python's `None`.
  - It also handles the `where` clause in SQL by parsing predicates, Boolean factors, and Boolean terms, saving operators and operands in a dictionary, which eventually becomes a nested dictionary.

- `db_model.py`
  - Uses a separate DB file to store and manage schema metadata (*Metadata schema*) and employs a *one DB-one schema* approach where a single DB file contains all records for one table. The reason for this is that `dbm` stores data in a key-value pair format within a single DB. When table keys and record keys are mixed within the same DB, inefficiencies can occur when trying to search for just one of them. Therefore, a `MetaDB` instance solely for managing metadata is continuously managed within the DBMS, and a new `DB` is created or opened for managing individual tables when necessary.
  - The `MetaDB` class stores table names as keys and `Table` instances as values in a `dbm` store, while the `DB` class stores the primary key or a randomly generated UUID (if no primary key exists) as key and `Record` instance as value.
  - Both `Table` and `Record` classes manage information about what tables or records they are referenced by and what columns or record values they are referencing. This allows quick integrity checks during operations like `DROP TABLE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`.
- `dbms.py`
  - Manages a `MetaDB` instance continuously within one `DBMS` instance, fetching table metadata as needed. 
  - Handles referential integrity during `INSERT` and `DELETE`
  - Executes `SELECT` by taking cartesian products of records from the involved tables and filters them based on `WHERE` clauses.
- `utils.py`
  - Enables flexible handling of operators, irrespective of the number of operands.
- `run.py`
  - Reads and processes queries until an "exit" command is encountered.
  - In case of syntax errors, it prints an error message and stops processing any remaining queries.
